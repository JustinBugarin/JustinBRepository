for the challenge I did my best to meet the criteria by making a couple of variables that will help me determine each section like, "criteria", "genNumber","genCharacter","genUppercase", and "genLowercase".

after making those variables I made a couple of arrays to determine the special characters, numbers, and letters.

I made a function will help with generating the password by asking how many characters between 8 to 128 as to what the assignment suggested.

after all the choices are selected it should generate a random password with how the user wished for.

I did my best but I did get some help from google by finding how to combine the arrays by ".concat"
